This portrait was painted by Tiberio Titi, a very good artist in the realization of portraits for the attention to details and sense of realism and the sketch artist of Medici’s family. The painting portrays the five sons of the duke of Bracciano Virginio Orsini (nephew of Cosimo I de’Medici) and his wife Flavia Damasceni Peretti (niece of the Pope Sisto V). The children are painted in front of an arcade of the lodge inside the castle of family on the lake of Bracciano, which is in the background and that was Orsini’s residence. 
The names of the children are written on the canvas and they help us identifying them. Carlo is the first from the left and is laying in a baby cot. He is wearing a bracelet made out of red coral, just like his brothers. He is looking out of the painting. The other kids are divided into two couples, establishing in this way the hierarchy of the siblings. All of them have golden ornaments on the suit. The youngest couple, Cosimo and Ferdinando (two and three years old), are wearing a long red dress, typical of the childhood, called “Ungherina”. Ferdinando holds in hand the family crest. The oldest two, Paolo Giordano and Alessandro (four and seven years old), are wearing a white silk suit, a rapier and a ruff around the neck. Alessandro is recognizable because he wears an inscription on the strap that gives us the information of his name, his age and the date of the painting: 1597.
