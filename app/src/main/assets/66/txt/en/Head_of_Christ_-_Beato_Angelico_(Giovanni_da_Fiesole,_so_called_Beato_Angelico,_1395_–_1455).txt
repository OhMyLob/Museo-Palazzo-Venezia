This is an irregular fragment of a fresco that reproduces the face of Christ in a frontal position. You can see the uncovered shoulders of the Christ that are covered by his long hair. His mouth is tight and his eyes are slightly half-closed. Initially this fresco was attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli for similar stylistic affinities with the face of San Sebastiano. Only recently it has been brought back to the soft and sintetic artistic trait of Beato Angelico, documented by the pieces of the frescoes of the Nicolino chapel, the only Roman pictorial enterprise of the Florentine artist who survived the destruction.
