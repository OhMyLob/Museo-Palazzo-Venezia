The figure represents the Madonna with a blue dress and a blue mantle on the outside and white on the inside.
Sheâ€™s represented on a low chair while holding her curly-haired Baby with her left arm.
There is a very intimate relationship between mother and child: the Madonna has a very tender look and a slight swelling on her stomach.
It is a work intended for a three-dimensional vision. In fact the back is also decorated and it partially retains its original colors.
