The Madonna of Acuto is so called because it was found in the  cathedral of Acute, a village near Fiuggi in Lazio.
The Madonna of Acuto is considered the most beautiful and the oldest of the Lazio sculptures.
The Madonna has a hunched attitude because it was positioned inside a niche and was intended only for a frontal view. The back is hollow so it was supposed to be also a relic holder. According to the opinion of some scholars, the presence of four authenthic precious stones (lapislazzuli, emerals and a turquoise on the round shape brooch) might confirm this hypothesis.
The rigidity, the position and the quite massive volumes are typical of the Romanesque style while the straight and fixed gaze comes directly from the images of the Byzantine icons.
The Madonna in her right arm holds the baby Jesus wearing a crown and with the intention of giving the blessing. The Virgin Mary indicates, with her hand, the text that the child holds in his left hand, so she is probably pointing the way, to mean that salvation is in the writings.
