This is probably a work by Vasari, created for Francis of Nicholas Vespucci in 1544.
The Madonna has an iridescent pink dress, a blue cloak wraps her right shoulder and a mauve colored fabric, stopped at the nape by a braid, covers her head. The gaze is deeply absorbed. With her left hand she supports the head of the sleeping Child, lying on his own mantle; the right hand is tenderly placed on the back of the infant St John to protect him and to include him in the embrace. He wears an animal skin, he supports with his left the wooden cross and with a gesture full of affection he caresses the hand of Baby Jesus. On the left, the representation is closed by the image of St. Joseph, wrapped in an ocher cloak, with an intense gaze on the Virgin.
The scene was a great success and it was repeated in numerous versions: the theme and the measures fitted perfect to private devotion and met the taste of Florentine collecting.
