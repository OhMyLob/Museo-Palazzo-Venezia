The painter, exponent of the Roman classicism of the 18th century, uses her daughter Faustina as a model for the Egyptian queen. He represents the seductive Cleopatra idealized and dressed according to the contemporary canons of beauty. The queen is in a theatrical and artificial pose and she is about to dissolve a big pearl of an earring in the wine, during a feast in honor of her lover Marco Antonio. This act shows to other people her detachement from wealths. The painting is a triumph of clothes and sumptuous textiles in the tonality of red enriched by a marble table and by a very long necklace of pearl leaned on a chair.
