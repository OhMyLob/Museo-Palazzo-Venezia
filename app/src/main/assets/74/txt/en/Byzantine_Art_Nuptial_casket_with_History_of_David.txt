The oldest artwork in this room, belongs to Byzantine art and was made between 850 and 900 a.C.
This object expresses the love and appreciation for refinement and luxury by the Byzantine people. It was made during the Macedonian Renaissance, or soon after the iconoclasm (it was forbidden to leak holy images or icons) of Byzantine Empire. 
It is a wedding gift for the marriage of the couple of Byzantine emperors, that are represented on the top. The inscription in Greek says “the imperial couple blessed by Christ”, associating the emperor’s soul to a “full vase of richness”, and the bride’s body to “a treasure of extraordinary abilities”. The scene of benediction perfectly explains the relationship between the chest and the biblical story described along the walls of the casket. The story, composed by 15 episodes, tells about David’s life, from his birth to his coronation as king of Israel: in the Bible he was called “Blessed by God”. The famous scene of the battle of Davide and Goliath is represented on the back of the box.
The casket is decorated with a particular sculpture technique, the high-relief, and the artist – who remained unknown - had the ability to highlight the spatiality and volume of the scenes that, considering the size of the object, it’s really amazing. 
The appearance of the box is made even more valuable by the fact that it’s not still in its original color. In fact it was decorated with red elements that we still can notice in some of the animals’ mouths and jaws.
