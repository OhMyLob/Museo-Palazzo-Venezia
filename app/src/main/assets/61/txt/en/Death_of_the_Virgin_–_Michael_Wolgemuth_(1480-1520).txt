The picture depicts one of the most important moments of Christ’s mother, described in the apocryphal book Transitus Maria. Many years after the Pentecost, when the Apostles were scattered in the world, an angel appeared to Maria to announce her death. She expressed her last wish, that was to see the Apostles again, so they gathered around her bed.
In this picture Maria is laying on a bed, depicted transversely to the observer, on the bedside a plate, tin pitcher and a rose (an ancient Marian symbol) are placed in a row. Maria is surrounded by the Apostles, that are distributed in space: among them someone is praying, someone searches in the Scriptures a reason and a comfort for the facts that have happened, someone is fixing the embers in the censer, someone wields the aspersorio with the holy water. John, the most beloved Apostle, hands Maria the traditional candle of the dead instead of the palm branch, the Redemption symbol. Above the figure of the Madonna stands a canopy still of Gothic type. The room opens with two mullioned windows on a late-medieval city, whose roofs and towers are crowned by the crescent moon that alludes to distant Jerusalem. The nine people in the foreground represent members of the donor's family: they are depicted in smaller dimensions as a sign of humility and respect towards the sacred subject in which they are inserted.The gold inserts on the fabrics depicted in the work, introduced in order to imitate the luxurious fabrics of brocade woven in gold, probably date back completely to the nineteenth or early twentieth century when the painting may have been repainted. The general layout of the painting and the construction of the faces clearly refer to the Nuremberg area and, specifically, to the Hans Traut’s shop.
