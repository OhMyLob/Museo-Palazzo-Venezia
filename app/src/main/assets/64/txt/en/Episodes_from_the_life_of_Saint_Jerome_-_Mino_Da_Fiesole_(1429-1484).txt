The four marble slabs were realised by Mino Da Fiesole, between 1461 and 1463, for the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. They were commissioned by the French cardinal Guillaume d’Estouteville, for the altar dedicated to Saint Girolamo, inside the basilica. In 1586 the altar was demolished, so the panels were transferred to the collection of Villa Peretti. Later on, around the end of the 19th century, Villa Peretti was demolished and the panels had to be moved again. First they were brought to the Artistic Industrial Museum and eventually, in 1975, they arrived to Palazzo Venezia. The slabs represent the main events of Saint Jerome’s life. The first one, bipartite, shows at the top the scene of “Penitent Saint Jerome”, set in the desert, with the Saint on his knees, in front of the crucifix, beating his chest with a rock; at the bottom there’s “Saint Jerome In His Office”, commenting the sacred scrolls. The second and the third slabs refer to the stories of the convent and they represent “Saint Jerome heals the Lion”, in which the Saint removes a thorn from the paw of the Lion, and “The Lion Brings Back The Animals To The Convent”, gesture of appreciation from the lion to his benefactor. The cycle, that originally was supposed to have more panels, ends with the “Vision of Saint Augustine” who became aware of the death of St Girolamo who appears in an almond with Saint Giovanni Battista.
