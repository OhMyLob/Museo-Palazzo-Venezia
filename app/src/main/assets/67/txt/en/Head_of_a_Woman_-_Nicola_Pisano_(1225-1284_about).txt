This veiled feminine head is a rare example of all round medieval sculpture carved in a mineral, maybe used as a decoration for a shelf or a capital. It's related to the author Nicola Pisano's first period in Tuscany (1245) after his education in Puglia in the workshops promoted by Frederick II, where people worked carving gems. Exactly this kind of education and the abundance of pyrite in Tuscany (in the isle of Elba) can explain the unusual choice of this material, usually known as  “the gold of the fools” for its golden glares. The elements of the face also recall other sculptures decorating the Cathedral of Siena, where Nicola worked until the first half of the XIII century.
