The Palazzo Venezia collection includes two statues, belonging to a wooden “sacra rappresentazione”, carved in the round, that depict the Magi Kings Caspar and Balthasar. The first is 174 cm tall and is covered with a blue azurite cloak, while the second is 176 cm tall, with a red cinnabar cloak. The statues come from the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica at Palazzo Barberini. The study of the two statues has been compromised by the damage that has been suffered, with the loss of a significant part of the painted surface and of several parts, including Balthasar’s left hand and forearm, and the gift he brought in his right, as well as part of the jar in Caspar’s hand, who is also missing the tip of his nose. They were probably made by the same workshop that made the group depicting an identical subject in Fabriano. The author of the two statues is probably Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, also known as The Master of the Magi from Fabriano, who was the sculpture of Nativity scenes, which are theatrical moments that represent scenes of Jesus life made in order to gather the faithful and pray.
