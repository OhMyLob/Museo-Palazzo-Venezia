The work, realized around 1575, shows the moment in between the deposition of the cross and the burial of Christ in the sepulcher. The representation is dominated by the darkness, behind the characters, and moreover by a few of vegetation. The people who were part of the procession are now gathered near Christ’s body. They are: Mary Magdalene that sprinkles the foot of Christ with ointments; Joseph of Arimathea who’s holding the nails of the cross; Nicodemus, that leans forward; John the Evangelist praying because of his desperation; Vergin Mary holding his son on his back and caressing him and an angel, keeping the crown of thorns in his hands.
Lelio Orsi, the painter, was particularly influenced by Michelangelo’s works, especially “La Pietà Colonna” (which is a highly finished drawing made at the request of Vittoria Colonna, among the most accomplished women of the Reinassance). Michelangelo’s representation in fact, shows Jesus and Mary in a position very similar to the one’s of Lelio Orsi’s work.
