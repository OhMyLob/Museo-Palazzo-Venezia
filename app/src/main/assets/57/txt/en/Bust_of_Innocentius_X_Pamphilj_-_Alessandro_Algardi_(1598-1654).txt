Innocenzo X was the successor of Pope Urban VIII. He was considered by some modern critics, “ugly and bad” and even in his epoch he had a bad notoriety above all because his ecclesiastical career was financed by Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, who was his sister in law. She was a Viterbese noble woman who dominated the politic scene of the time and that, in change of his help, asked for more and more power and money.
The particularity of this bust is that it is made of terracotta. In fact, at the beginning it had only to be a sketch, but it was so good that the artist Alessandro Algardi decided to keep it the way it was and covered it with stucco and marble dust. Moreover the high executive quality of this piece suggested a use of terracotta as a model for a series of portraits of the pontiff, made by the Bolognese sculptor from 1652. In his face traits, finely described, we can see a deep sense of disappointment along with his dignity and the consciousness of his role. The Algardistic portraits, in fact, prefer the introspective and naturalistic research of the subject rather than the representation of power
Innocenzo wears the “camauro” (a typical hat), the “mozzetta” (the mantle) and a scarf with doves and lilies, which are the symbols of Pamphili’s family. We can find the same symbols in Piazza Navona where the architects Borromini and Rainaldi renoved for the Pope the main urban residence of the family: Palazzo Pamphili, nowadays the residence of the Brasilian Embassy. 
After his death, Innocenzo was buried in the church of Sant’Agnese in Agone a 17th-century Baroque church that faces onto the Piazza Navona, and which was also built by – among others  - the architect Borromini. Also Bernini worked for the pope: he was the author of the famous fountain in the middle of the square.
