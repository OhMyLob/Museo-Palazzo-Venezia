The sculpture, bought by Vespasiano Pitassi in 1924 in Pacentro (near Lâ€™Aquila) represents the standing Madonna with the chest slightly arched to the right, placing the weight of the body on the left leg. It follows a French model of the twelfth century which later spread to Italy. Thanks to this position the whole composition is soft and sinuous. On her left arm the baby Jesus is sitting, wearing a blue tunic with flowers and golden pois. Also gold is the colour of the mantle covering his legs. Mary wears a red tunic with liliums (that allude to her virginity and to the real French family of the Angioni) and golden pois. The mantle, long to the feet, is golden like that of baby Jesus and is retained on the head by a crown (only partially entire). It is enriched by a blue hem made of a precious lapis lazuli powder. The sculpted group was probably intended for a frontal vision as in the backside there is a complete lack of manufacturing and colours. It was probably in a lifted up position, as the Madonna hinted a smile to her baby but not to the faithful beholder.
