This work is called "Terracina Case" because it has been found inside the Cathedral of Terracina in 1889 without its orginal cover. It was probably used for preserving liturgic documents and paraments in ecclesiastical. On the front side there are three wedges that correspond to three locks. Only the first one is original and it is also the only one that doesn't cover the decorations, while the other two locks have been added sacrifing a part of the decoration.
The chest has a very complex decoration divided into two registres: it is an example of “Biblia pauperum” or rather the bibbia of the poor people, where the figurative elements have to leave a strong emotional impact to make clear the concepts only thanks to figures. The principal scene that contains the meaning of the whole work, is set to the center and represents the original sin of Adam and Eve; above these scene is represented an eagle that seizes a snake to symbolize the struggle between the good and the evil. Then are represented some centaurs that fight against knights. Centaurs are creatures partly man and partly animal that point out monstruosity, while the knight is considered the paladin of the good. The four figures overtop a calf, a lion, a bear and an ox. The recurrent theme in all the scenes immortalizes dualism among good and evil, a typical theme of the Middle Age art.
