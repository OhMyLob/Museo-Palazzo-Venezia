The "Lamentation over the Dead Christ" is a painting made around 1612-15 by the Roman painter Orazio Borgianni, during his last few years of life. It is characterized by a dramatic setting, as can be noticed from the body of Christ in the foreground that shows the signs of the wounds left by the nails. The body is laid on a marble slab (the so-called stone of anointment, where according to Christian tradition the body of Jesus was prepared for burial). Around the body are represented the figures of St. John the Evangelist, of Mary Magdalene and of the Virgin Mary who is praying. Light is concentrated entirely on Christ’s body and it spreads from it creating strong light and dark contrasts that recall elements of Caravaggio’s style, followed by the painter. 
Borgianni was inspired by the "Dead Christ" by Andrea Mantegna, a painting that dates back to around 1475-78, now in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan. Mantegna offered an original representation of the theme of the Lamentation over the Dead Christ, breaking away from tradition and representing rationality in the painting. After centuries, Mantegna has also given suggestions to the cinema. In fact in the film by Pier Paolo Pasolini "Mamma Roma", in the final scenes we witness the death of one of the protagonists, Ettore, in which there is a reference to the dead Christ of Mantegna.
