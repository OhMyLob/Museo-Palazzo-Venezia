This is the traditional scene where the Three Wise Men give their gifts to Jesus. The scene takes place outdoor, in the foreground we can see the remains of a colonade that symbolize the victory of Christianity over paganism. The procession is characterized, in the background, by the presence of camels that the artist represented in an imaginary way, while on the right in foreground we can see a young boy who is the only one dressed according to the late sixteenth century fashion. The little boy gives one of the gifts and draws the Three Wise men's attention besides him. In the foreground there is also the oldest of the Three Wise Men, Melchiorre, who is kneeling down at Jesusâ€™ feet. Above all it's clear the guiding star. In this work the bright colors and the camels presence, a symbol of exotic, represent Mannerism features.
