This object was made in the period of Pope Innocenzo III (1198-1215). It is made of golden bronze and decorated with reliefs. It has a semicircle shape and its use was to decorate the upper part of a niche: the Nicchia dei Palli, situated under the altar in Saint Peter’s Church. This Nicchia contained a bronze urn in which the Palli were preserved. The Palli are a sort of wool-made scarfs, typical of archibishops’ clothing, made by nuns in the church of S. Cecilia in Trastevere. Soon after they were ready, they were put in the niche and then blessed, to be given to 24 bishops on June 29th, Saint Peter and Paul’s Day. 
In the center of this object we can see Jesus Christ represented as “the Lamb of Salvation”. Around it, we find four elements (commonly called “tetramorfo”) that symbolize the four evangelists.
In the upper part of the object, the twelve apostles are represented and at the bottom there are some prophets (their names are also written down there).
