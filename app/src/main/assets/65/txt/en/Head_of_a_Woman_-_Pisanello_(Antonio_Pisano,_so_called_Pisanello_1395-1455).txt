This “Head of a Woman” is a fragmentary fresco dating back to 1431-1432, whose author was Pisanello. The work was purchased in 1922 because it was thought it was a fragment of the lost frescoes in San Giovanni in Laterano, made by Pisanello and Gentile da Fabriano; however this hypotesis is not verifiable. Only in the sixties, with the discovery of the frescoes of the Ducale Palace of Mantua, has been recognised a deep affinity between the lady here in Palazzo Venezia and the one of the other work, whose author was certainly Pisanello. The small fragment represents a princess in profile, slightly turned towards the viewer, with a typical hairstyle of the fifteenth century, the very high and protrunding shaved forehead, hair knotted by ribbons and a band and curls, which fall on her temples. Moreover the lines are very accurate, as you see by observing the nose, the slender neck and the relaxed half- closed eyes.
